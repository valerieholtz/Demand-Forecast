An approach to Machine Learning with Linear Regression
- *Explorative Data Analysis* and *Feature Engineering* to construct a robust models to estimate number of bike rentals
- *OLS* and *Recursive Feature Elimination* to pick the best features for the Linear model
- *GridSearchCV* to attain the best fitting model and parameters

### Guideline questions for the EDA:
- Which weather conditions and time criteria impact registered users to use bike sharing company's rental bicycles as registered users?

### Summary of the OLS Regression results:
